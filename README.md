# chess.rs
chess.rs is a chess game developed in rust with SDL2 ! This project has been developed in order to learn Rust through self thought projects !

## Roadmap:

* Make a board where you can drag and drop pieces, and a player cannot play the ennemy pieces.  ✅
* Make a turn by turn system. ✅
* Include the FEN Notation to initialize a board. ✅
* Made every movement rules for pieces ✅ (en passant check: ❌)
